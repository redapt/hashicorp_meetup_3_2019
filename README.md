# Hashicorp Meetup Terraform  March 6, 2019

Terraform code for Hashicorp meetup 3/6/2019

## This repo is weird!

This repo should *not* work directly off of the master branch.  It is intended to show how microservices and layering should be applied in Terraform, particularly in multi-cloud.

The working branch is `jenkins`, otherwise building from any of the others should work for their respective components.
